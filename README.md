# Kineticist Elements Expanded

Mod for Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous


## Credits and Acknowledgement

Thanks to [Truinto][1] author of [Dark Codex][2] for providing help, advice, and some methods so I could gain my own footing in C# and modding P:WoTR

Thanks to the entire OwlCat community discord and the modding community there, for answering my plethora of strange questions and pushing me in the right directions

Thank you to [Adsam112][3] for some custom icon images for the Void Element
Thank you to [RevanStarForge][4] for some color variations of those images. And for creating a whole bunch of new images for Void, Wood, and Aether!

## Description

This mod adds expanded element choices for the Kineticist class. Currently this mod adds only the "Aether" element from the Tabletop version of Pathfinder.
More elements may be coming in the future.

Added elements means: More blast types, More infusions, wild talents, Elemental Defense, etc.

This mod originally started as a personal project to add my favorite element, Aether, to the game. But I have expanded the scope to encompass any other elements others might want to add to the game.

If you have any suggestions for elements to add to the game, please reach out to me, write an issue for the repo, etc.

Thank you for reading!

I also do not have the skills currently to add custom effects to the game, so any element added will borrow the effect from other kineticist elements.
I shall try to match the theme/element of the ability as best as possible to make it visually appealing

## Help Requested

There are a lot of spell effects in game, and I've added a lot of spells, spell-likes, and special abilities that I cannot add all of the required FX or icons myself

If you come across any icons or FX (projectiles/AoE/etc) that you think might fit one of these abilities, please let me know and I'll get them added soon
Thank you!!

## Compatibility

This mod should be compatible with most other mods, as it only adds options to character choices.
Some mods might not integrate perfectly, but they should work together properly

If you notice any issues, please contact me or open up an issue on this repository

## Recent Changes

### v2.5.2

- Fix Negative Energy Kinetic Blade Text

### v2.5.3

- Fix an issue where everyone was getting Aether Class skills, except it was actually void class skills
- Buffed Wood Soldiers (They're supposed to have the "Advanced Template")
- Noticed an issue with Skilled Kineticist and Kinetic Knights

## Known Issues

### Disintigration Infusion
This is a very strange infusion, both doubling damage, and halving it. For whatever reason, it does not work with the Spindle infusion, still working on that

### Admixtures
These work pretty well in all cases, I have only seen a single issue: When using either of the energy admixtures, and you crit, the damage modified by the admixture will not deal double damage, but the original damage type will.

### Wood Soldiers
It is possible, if you use the ability after one or two dies, to have up to 7 wood soldiers, still trying to figure out how to limit the amount of summons
Using the ability at 4 or more Soldiers causes you to take burn, but does not summon soldiers (Max 4, but the ability shouldnt go off)
